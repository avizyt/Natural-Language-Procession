    "\n",
    "He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His\n",
    "garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more\n",
    "like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,\n",
    "dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time\n",
    "he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which\n",
    "invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a\n",
    "sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was\n",
    "hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but\n",
    "for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,\n",
    "verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in\n",
    "himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not\n",
    "only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the\n",
    "anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had\n",
    "given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all\n",
    "desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror\n",
    "for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her\n",
    "trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats\n",
    "and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to\n",
    "lie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and\n",
    "slip out unseen.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\n",
    "aware of his fears.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\n",
    "trifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm... yes, all is in a man’s\n",
    "hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would\n",
    "be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\n",
    "step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\n",
    "too much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\n",
    "that I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this\n",
    "last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\n",
    "Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\n",
    "_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse\n",
    "myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\n",
    "and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\n",
    "special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\n",
    "of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man’s already\n",
    "overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\n",
    "are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\n",
    "whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\n",
    "the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\n",
    "disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was,\n",
    "by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,\n",
    "well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank\n",
    "into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness\n",
    "of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring\n",
    "to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the\n",
    "habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these\n",
    "moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a\n",
    "tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted\n",
    "food.\n",
    "He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would\n",
    "have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter\n",
    "of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have\n",
    "created surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number\n",
    "of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading\n",
    "and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the\n",
    "heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets\n",
    "that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was\n",
    "such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that,\n",
    "in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least\n",
    "of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with\n",
    "acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked\n",
    "meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown\n",
    "reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy\n",
    "dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: “Hey there, German\n",
    "hatter” bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young\n",
    "man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall\n",
    "round hat from Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all\n",
    "torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly\n",
    "fashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror\n",
    "had overtaken him.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I knew it,” he muttered in confusion, “I thought so! That’s the worst\n",
    "of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might\n",
    "spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd\n",
    "and that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any\n",
    "sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such\n",
    "a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What\n",
    "matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them\n",
    "a clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as\n",
    "possible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it’s just such\n",
    "trifles that always ruin everything....”\n",
    "\n",
    "He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate\n",
    "of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted\n",
    "them once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no\n",
    "faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous\n",
    "but daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon\n",
    "them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at\n",
    "his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\n",
    "this “hideous” dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he\n",
